The SECLitMarch8 file comes from a research project in which we tracked and recorded information about SEC enforcement actions filed against public companies listed on major U.S. exchanges, as well as their subsidiaries, on March 8, 2023. Our aim is to determine how many of these companies attempted to settle with the SEC before the final round of pre-trial motions was filed.
